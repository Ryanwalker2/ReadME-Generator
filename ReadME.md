## Description 

  The idea for this project was to create an application that can be used to speed up and standardize the making of a ReadME.md file for future projects. In using this it will allow the user more time to focus on the code for their project rather than spend that time creating a ReadME file for it. 

## Installation 

  To install this project, clone the git repository to your local. Once it has been installed, navigate to any terminal that is compatible with node.js. Navigate to the directory that conatins the index.js file that was cloned to your local. Then, enter "node index.js" into the terminal to begin the program. 

## Usage 

  Once the index.js file is run using node.js. The terminal with prompt you with several questions. The information you enter into these prompts will be used directly to generate your ReadME.md file. Feel free to input as much or as little information as you like.(This information can be modified afterwards) Once all of the prompts have been answered, a ReadME.md file will be created in the same directory as the index.js file.
